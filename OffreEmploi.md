## Postdoc position on multi-energy system planing
<a id="postdocplanetterr">

This post-doc position is proposed in the frame of a 4 years collaborative national research project [PlaneTerr](https://planeterr.fr/) with French compagnies RTE, GRTGaz, AirLiquide and TotalEnergies.
The aim is to contribute to the developpement of open source models for the decarbonation of multi-energy systems. Depending on the candidate, the mission will be to coordinate one or several research actions among that of the project, in collaboration with industrial partners : on multi-energy system planning, demand modeling (industry decarbonation, electric vehicle, building, ...), renewable production modeling, DSO-TSO coordination, CO2 circular economy infrastructures,... Among others, the post-doc will contribute to the coordination of the academic contributions of MINES Paris that will be carried out by our team that will include four PhD students
- Optimization (already started)
- Multi-energy planning (already started)
- Distribution-transport coordination of operation and planning in the electric system (to start in 2024)
- multi-resource system (including CO2 planning) (to start in 2024)

The candidate will also be involved in the supervision of some of the PhDs. He will join a very active research group in the field of decarbonization modeling. The position will be full-time for one to three years and will be located in the PERSEE center of MINES Paris PSL, located in Sophia Antipolis in the South of France.
