**Mini CV --** Anaëlle Jodry obtained an engineering diploma from École des Mines d'Albi in 2018, specializing in renewable energy development and resource conversion. Then, she worked in a solar energy company to investigate the impact of solar thermal energy on the quality of domestic hot water for a national study in partnership with ADEME. She also worked for the local gas and electricity distribution network of Grenoble as a flexibility mechanism project manager.

**PhD description --** In December 2023, she defended her PhD thesis on decision support for the development of hydrogen technologies at the scale of a territory. Through energy system optimization, her work allows understanding the role of hydrogen, a key chemical and energy carrier in the transition. The developed model is especially suitable for studying the evolution of industrial clusters and was tested in the Fos-sur-Mer harbor in the south of France. Different analyses highlighted some key factors to take into account when developing hydrogen ecosystems: gas prices, CO2 capture and treatment prices, and the space available to build renewables dedicated to hydrogen production.
