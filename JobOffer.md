##  PhD position - Integrating CO2 resources into territorial energy planning.
<a id="theseplanetterr4">
In industry decarbonization, CO2 capture for reuse or storage plays a crucial role, such as in producing e-fuels, e-plastics [REF Zenon](https://www.zenon.ngo/insights/sustainable-aviation-fuels-safs), or decarbonizing cement. It also contributes to system hybridization, exemplified by low-carbon hydrogen production  [Jodry2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623029086). However, the necessary infrastructure for CO2 transport, temporary or permanent storage, and reuse is often overlooked in prospective modeling works. This thesis aims to address this gap by integrating CO2 infrastructure into the multi-energy decarbonization planning of an industrial region, enabling economic and environmental evaluation, including CO2 capture, investment description, and potential financing challenges.

This thesis aims to create a methodological framework for optimized multi-resource planning of integrated energy systems, including CO2 capture, transport, reuse, and storage infrastructure. It builds on the [SPHYDERS](https://git.persee.mines-paristech.fr/energy-alternatives/operation-and-planning) open-source model developed from [Jodry2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623029086) and links with ongoing industrial decarbonization research pursued at the PERSEE center [These Thibaut](https://www.robingirard.eu/StudentList.html#ThibautKnibiehly) and [These Quentin](https://www.robingirard.eu/StudentList.html#QuentinRaillard-Cazanove). Conducted within the [PlaneTerr](https://planeterr.fr/) project alongside energy industry partners, this framework seeks to develop low-carbon energy transition strategies for industrial territories, considering complex interactions between energy production, use, and CO2 management, and assesses CO2 capture and valorization benefits for greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.


This thesis will be supervised by Pedro Affonsso Nobrega and Robin Girard, with the student based at the PERSEE center in Sophia Antipolis, although a Paris location may be considered. Please send your CV at robin.girard@minesparis.psl.eu
