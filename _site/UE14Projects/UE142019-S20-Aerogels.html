<p>(Encadrant : Tatiana Budtova)</p>

<p>Decreasing the energy consumption is currently one of the most important
global concerns. For example, buildings are responsible of more than 25%
CO~2~ emissions and 45% of energy consumption. These emissions are
mainly linked to limited thermal insulation. To change this dramatic
situation it is necessary to find new generation of thermal insulation
materials. One way is the<strong>development of high performance thermal
insulating materials</strong>. These are the innovative <em>thermal
super-insulating materials</em>, i.e. with thermal conductivity below that
of air (0.025 W/(m.K)) in ambient conditions.</p>

<p>There are two families of super-insulating materials and components:</p>

<p>1)  One is Vacuum Insulation Panels, which are mature enough (Technology
    Readiness Level index, TRL = 8-9) with very low conductivity (around
    0.007 W/(m.K) for the whole life effective conductivity); however,
    they are rather brittle and difficult to install.</p>

<p>2)  The second is the Super-Insulation at Atmospheric Pressure
    materials. They are exclusively represented by aerogels, which are
    “intrinsically” super-insulating at the atmospheric pressure due to
    their mesoporosity (Knudsen effect), their low density and
    nanostructured solid backbone. Typical aerogels are made of silica
    and their composites, with TRL = 5-8 and conductivity around 0.015
    W/(m.K) /1/. Their main drawbacks are high brittleness and also
    their significant dust emission. For the time being, they remain
    rather expensive (around 2000 euros/m^3^) and thus used only in
    niche markets. Organic (polyurethane) aerogels are under industrial
    development with strong advancements made by BASF (Slentite™ with
    thermal conductivity around 0.016 W/(m.K)). However, polyurethane
    chemistry is harsh.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 21st century a new generation of aerogels
appeared: bio-aerogels (based on polysaccharides). They are finely
structured (specific surface area of 200-600 m^2^/g), mechanically
strong (with a large plastic deformation region till 60-80% strain
before pore collapse) and are thus a very promising alternative to
silica and synthetic polymer based aerogels. Large amount of literature
reports on thermal super-insulating properties of silica aerogels and
ways of improving their mechanical properties /1/. Bio-aerogels are in
the very early state: their use is suggested as matrices for drug
delivery and their carbons for catalysis and electrode materials. It is
only recently that some bio-aerogels were reported to be thermal
super-insulating materials with conductivities around 0.016 – 0.020
W/(m.K) /2-4/.</p>

<p>The goal of this project the possibilities, for bio-aerogels, to compete
with classical inorganic and synthetic polymer aerogels in terms of
performance and price, the latter including the price of materials and
processing?</p>
