<p>France like other EU member states is in the process of decarbonizing
its economy and reducing energy insecurity. Biomass will play an
important role in the transition to a low carbon economy and in reaching
the French targets for renewable energy. Currently, bioenergy production
in France is mainly based on residues such as forest and agricultural
residues. The increasing demand for bioenergy may, however, require that
biomass is grown specifically for energy purposes. Miscanthus (a
fast-growing biomass) is a well established and abundant biomass
resource in France and has a key position regarding modern biomass use.
There are proven technologies converting biomass to bioenergy (either
heat, electricity, biofuels). Among these technologies, biomass
gasification offers several advantages compared to combustion-based
processes, the most prominent being possibility for downstream
conversion to biofuels and the potential for higher electrical
efficiency if used for electricity generation in a biomass integrated
gasification combined cycle. Biomass gasification in general has a
considerable surplus of heat which facilitates integration with district
heating or industrial processes.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to assess whether the production of
bioelectricity from miscanthus is economically viable in France and to
assess the climate impact of miscanthus based bioelectricity generation
in France. The project will use primary and secondary data. To a large
extend it will be based on the survey data (primary data) collected from
farmers and energy companies using questionnaires. Secondary data
collection tools are internet, databases, news papers, published
research articles etc. Cost-Benefits analysis will be used to estimate
the costs and benefits of miscanthus based bioelectricity <em>(a developed
tool could be provided to students for this purpose).</em> A streamlined
life cycle assessment will be used to assess the energy use and
greenhouse gas emissions of the investigated bioenergy system <em>(a
simplified LCA model could be given to students).</em></p>

<p>The concept of energy return on energy invested (EROI) will be used to
investigate whether bioelectricity is a net energy provider. Sensitivity
analyses will be used to understand the relationship between input and
output variables in the system. The project will generate new knowledge
about possible use of bioenergy energy in France. It will also document
the costs, benefits, and global warming potential of biomass
gasification base-electricity for the region of France.</p>
