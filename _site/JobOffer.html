<h2 id="postdoc-position-on-multi-energy-system-planing">Postdoc position on multi-energy system planing</h2>
<p><a id="postdocplanetterr"></a></p>

<p>This post-doc position is proposed in the frame of a 4 years collaborative national research project <a href="https://planeterr.fr/">PlaneTerr</a> with French compagnies RTE, GRTGaz, AirLiquide and TotalEnergies.
The aim is to contribute to the developpement of open source models for the decarbonation of multi-energy systems. Depending on the candidate, the mission will be to coordinate one or several research actions among that of the project, in collaboration with industrial partners : on multi-energy system planning, demand modeling (industry decarbonation, electric vehicle, building, …), renewable production modeling, DSO-TSO coordination, CO2 circular economy infrastructures,… Among others, the post-doc will contribute to the coordination of the academic contributions of MINES Paris that will be carried out by our team that will include four PhD students</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimization (already started)</li>
  <li>Multi-energy planning (already started)</li>
  <li>Distribution-transport coordination of operation and planning in the electric system (to start in 2024)</li>
  <li>multi-resource system (including CO2 planning) (to start in 2024)</li>
</ul>

<p>The candidate will also be involved in the supervision of some of the PhDs. He will join a very active research group in the field of decarbonization modeling. The position will be full-time for one to three years and will be located in the PERSEE center of MINES Paris PSL, located in Sophia Antipolis in the South of France. Being located in Paris might be a possible option too. Net salary : around 2500 € /month.</p>
