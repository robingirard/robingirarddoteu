Coupling optimisation methodology for energy system planning. <br>
PhD funded by the  <a href="https://planeterr.fr/"> PlaneTerr</a>. project, in collaboration with several french energy system compagnies.



<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-hamburger-92a994161/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Hugo Hamburger obtained an engineering degree from Centrale Lille and an MSc in Sustainable Energy from DTU, with a specialization in energy systems analysis. He did his master's thesis at RTE on the coupling of energy system models. He continued on the topic by starting his PhD in October 2023 as part of the PlaneTerr project in collaboration with RTE and Mines Paris PSL.  The subject is entitled "Coupling optimization method for energy system planning".

**PhD description --** In the field of energy systems, the energy transition is driving massive changes in system variability and uncertainty.  To ensure the system's adequacy and reliability, these changes need to be accounted for in the models. In particular, this means using higher spatio-temporal resolution, planning on a longer time scale, and considering interactions between energy vectors. However, when translated into energy system models, they give rise to large-scale non-convex problems which in practice are not tractable.  The aim of this thesis is to solve this type of long-term, adequate multi-energy system planning problem by developing new non-exact but tractable optimization methods, based on model coupling. The general idea is to leverage the potential of investment planning models (e.g. OSeMOSYS) by linking them to high-resolution adequacy models (e.g. ANTARES), which can be regarded as a kind of dialogue between these models.

Planning of multi-energy system. <br>
PhD funded by the  <a href="https://planeterr.fr/"> PlaneTerr</a>. project, in collaboration with several french energy system compagnies.


<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaut-knibiehly/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Thibaut Knibiehly graduated from Ecole polytechnique and Mines Paris PSL in 2022 in engineering. After specializing in energy systems modelling, he joined an energy consulting company as an intern to work on power system decarbonisation strategy. He continued with another internship at the Swiss TSO to benchmark two adequacy simulation tools. Since June 2023, he joined the PERSEE centre and is currently a first year PhD candidate working on "optimisation of operation and planning of an industrial multi-energy hub" in collaboration with RTE.

**PhD description --** The decarbonisation of the energy system in 2050 will lead to a significant change in energy demand. The need for fossil fuels will gradually be replaced by a demand of electricity, bio-fuels or e-fuels (hydrogen, e-methane, bio-methane, low-temperature heat, etc.). At the same time, the electricity grid is phasing out emitting thermal generation, creating new needs to ensure grid stability, particularly in terms of storage. Modelling the conversions between energy vectors makes it possible to reduce the costs of decarbonisation, by optimising the deployment of new infrastructure. The aim of this thesis is to study a problem of optimal pathways of a multi-energy system by modelling an industrial hub. The questions to be studied are: - What are the optimal technologies in terms of cost to produce hydrogen or other decarbonised vectors? - What is the role of carbon capture in the model, based on cost assumptions? - For which energy carriers and how should daily, weekly and seasonal energy storage be sized?

Integrating CO2 resources into territorial energy planning.
PhD Student since October 2024 <br>

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-berchiche-10480218a/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Maria Berchiche holds a double Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Economics from Université Paris-Saclay and a Master’s degree in Energy and Finance from Paris Dauphine-PSL. After a research internship at IFPEN, where she worked on defining business models for the deployment of CCUS technologies in France, she joined the PERSEE center and is currently a PhD candidate working on the integration of CO₂ infrastructure into energy systems modelling, as part of the PlaneTerr project and in collaboration with NaTran.

**PhD description --** The management of CO₂ is becoming a central pillar of industrial decarbonization, as many sectors will continue to generate residual emissions in a net-zero scenario. While carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is increasingly included in national climate strategies,the required infrastructures remain largely under-represented in energy system planning models. The objective of this PhD is to integrate CO₂ management infrastructures into multi-energy system planning in order to identify cost-optimal investment pathways for industrial decarbonization. The work combines spatial modelling of CO₂ networks at multiple scales, techno-economic assessment of CCUS relative to alternative mitigation options, detailed representation of CO₂ utilization routes, and carbon accounting of fossil and biogenic CO₂ flows, to provide a consistent framework for planning future CO₂ management systems.

LCA of building renovation toward carbon neutrality. <br>
PhD funded by <a href="http://www.cstb.fr/fr/"> CSTB</a>.


<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibault-goessel/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Thibault Goessel is a graduate of the engineering school Mines Paris-PSL, specializing in the environmental impacts of materials. His academic experience was reinforced with a research project with Karibati, focusing on the life cycle analysis of hemp concrete. During his tenure at EDF R&D for his end-of-study stage, Thibault worked on integrating environmental criteria into construction projects, showcasing his commitment to sustainable practices. Since November 2022, Thibault has started a thesis in collaboration with the PERSEE center and the CSTB (Scientific and Technical Center for Building). The subject concerns the identification of optimal building renovation solutions, as well as the impact of their massification across the French building stock. His supervisory team is composed of Robin Girard as his thesis director, alongside Simon Ligier and Adélaïde Aublet-Mailhac as CSTB supervisors.


**PhD description --** The massification of energy renovation is one of the key decarbonization levers identified in the building sector. However, renovation strategies are often approached through the traditional focus on energy performance during operation. Furthermore, the large-scale consequences of energy renovation massification are scarcely studied, despite its potential massive impacts on other sectors of the economy, such as energy, forestry, or industry. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) of renovation strategies lies at the heart of the thesis by integrating environmental, economic, and social issues into the identification of renovation strategies. On the building scale, carbon footprint, overall cost, and thermal comfort throughout the building's life cycle will be directly integrated to assess optimal renovation strategies for each major building typology. The figure below describes the methodology. On the French building stock scale, prospective dynamics of major sectors of the economy dependent on renovation will be incorporated for the study.

Vectors coupling in the 2050 european energy system. <br>
CIFRE PhD funded by french TSO <a href="https://www.rte-france.com/"> RTE</a>.


<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-vrain-16a049172/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Maxime Vrain specialized in Energy/Climate issues during his engineering curriculum in Ecole polytechnique and Mines de Paris. After a research internship on induced seismicity by Geothermal plants with Caltech and an engineering internship on nuclear safety with EDF, he joined the PERSEE centre as a PhD. candidate to work on multi-energy systems in collaboration with RTE.

**PhD description --** Effectively decarbonising the European energy system requires an intensification of coupling between energy carriers: electricity, methane, hydrogen, and heating networks in this thesis. The power system is already at the heart of these couplings because of the technologies directly linking it to all the other vectors. And this role will grow as a result of the indirect electrification via hydrogen or heat. This development increases electricity demand but can also provide flexibility: better control of demand according to renewable production, access to storage, etc. The aim of this thesis is to gain a better understanding of the consequences of different energy carriers’ development scenarios on the operation of the power system in 2050.

PhD funded by the  <a href ="https://www.carnot-mines.eu/fr"> Institut Carnot MINES</a>.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-raillard/"> Linkedin  </a>

**Mini CV --** Quentin Raillard-Cazanove graduated from Arts et Métiers (MEng) and Loughborough University (MSc in Renewable Energy Systems Technology) in 2021. His Master's thesis, which centred on the examination of residential consumption data for the competitiveness of residential PV+BES systems, provided him with a firsthand encounter of the academic research landscape. This experience has motivated him to initiate a PhD thesis, wherein he is exploring the decarbonisation of industry and its impact on the electricity system.


**PhD description --** In the effort to reduce carbon emissions in industry, there is widespread consideration for both direct and indirect electrification of production methods. However, the electricity system must prepare to manage the ensuing rise in demand.  By studying possible developments in the decarbonisation of industry under various future technical and economic conditions, this thesis will identify the various synergies that the electrical system can have with industry, in particular through the service that industry can provide to the electrical system through the potential flexibilisation of its demand.
