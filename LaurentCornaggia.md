**Mini CV --** Laurent Cornaggia holds an engineering diploma from l’Ecole Polytechnique and an MSc in mechanical engineering from EPFL. Following an initial experience in a startup focused on micro-power plants utilizing waste heat, he joined Artelys as a project manager in energy consulting. In this role, he specialized in areas such as cost-benefit analysis, power markets, sector coupling, optimization, and prospective studies. In January 2023, Laurent started a CIFRE thesis in collaboration with RTE and Mines Paris-PSL, titled "Decision-making Method for the Development of DC Network Architectures Connected to the Transport Network."

**PhD description --** His thesis aims at comparing AC and DC network architectures at medium to high voltage (ranging from 1 to 100 kV DC pole-to-pole) to ascertain the advantages of DC over traditional AC connections. Laurent presented a conference paper titled "Comparison of Losses and Costs between AC and MVDC Connections for New DC Resources" at ISGT Europe 2023, publicly available [here](https://backoffice.inviteo.com/upload/compte218/Base/inscriptions_projets/fichier/08788-fichier.pdf). This paper explores the losses and costs associated with AC and MVDC connections from a point-to-point perspective. Presently, his primary focus involves the development of methodologies for computing additional comparison criteria between AC and DC architectures. This encompasses evaluating factors such as security of supply, environmental impact, and ancillary services. Furthermore, Laurent's thesis contributes to the RACCOR-D project led by the French railway operator SNCF réseau, where various AC and DC architectures connected to the transport network are envisioned, involving a combination of railway MVDC networks, batteries, and solar plants.
